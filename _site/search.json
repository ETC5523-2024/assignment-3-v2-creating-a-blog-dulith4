    "text": "Data to be identfied\nAs for this blog post the data was retrieved from the ‚ÄúTidyTuesday‚Äù Git Repository which provides the Holiday movie dataset.\n\nData Description\nThere are mainly two datasets which have been used for this analysis, which are holiday_movies.csv and holiday_movie_genre.csv. In this blog I won‚Äôt be talking about the entire two datasets but only the key factors of the two.\nIn the holiday_movies.csv contains the movies which have been produced from 1929-2023. There are many types of movies which have been produced over the years. There are 2265 observations and 14 variables. These variables consist of the movie name, unique identifier of the title (tconst), year of the movie released, genre, movie run time and average ratings of IMDb, these are some of the key variables of the dataset.\nIn the holiday_movie_genre.csv contains the genre of the movies. As readers you might be wondering why there is another table for movie genre when you can find it in the first table itself? The reason for it is that for analysis purpose. In movies it is common to have more than one genre and in the first table in a single row it contains more than one genre but for analysis purpose it is hard as a solution if a movie has more than one genre it has been broken into single value. In this dataset it contains 4531 observations and 2 variables which are unique identifier of the title (tconst) and genres.\n\n\nData Cleaning\nThe dataset used in this analysis was obtained from the TidyTuesday repository and came pre-cleaned. No additional significant cleaning was required before analysis. The data was structured in a way that facilitated direct analysis, allowing us to dive straight into understanding genre distributions, rating trends, and holiday representations.\nAlthough some cleaning was done for this analysis in the holiday_movie_genre.csv there were some genre which are not related to movies such as Music, Talk-Show, News, Reality-TV, Sport were filtered out.\nAlso in holiday_movies.csv the variables which contains of Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa were logical factors and for analysis purpose it was converted into integer factor."
