    "text": "Data to be identfied\nAs for this blog post the data was retrieved from the ‚ÄúTidyTuesday‚Äù Git Repository which provides the Holiday movie dataset.\n\nData Description\nThere are mainly two datasets which have been used for this analysis, which are holiday_movies.csv and holiday_movie_genre.csv. In this blog I won‚Äôt be talking about the entire two datasets but only the key factors of the two.\nIn the holiday_movies.csv contains the movies which have been produced from 1929-2023. There are many types of movies which have been produced over the years. There are 2265 observations and 14 variables. These variables consist of the movie name, unique identifier of the title (tconst), year of the movie released, genre, movie run time and average ratings of IMDb, these are some of the key variables of the dataset.\nIn the holiday_movie_genre.csv contains the genre of the movies. As readers you might be wondering why there is another table for movie genre when you can find it in the first table itself? The reason for it is that for analysis purpose. In movies it is common to have more than one genre and in the first table in a single row it contains more than one genre but for analysis purpose it is hard as a solution if a movie has more than one genre it has been broken into single value. In this dataset it contains 4531 observations and 2 variables which are unique identifier of the title (tconst) and genres.\n\n\nData Cleaning\nThe dataset used in this analysis was obtained from the TidyTuesday repository and came pre-cleaned. No additional significant cleaning was required before analysis. The data was structured in a way that facilitated direct analysis, allowing us to dive straight into understanding genre distributions, rating trends, and holiday representations.\nAlthough some cleaning was done for this analysis in the holiday_movie_genre.csv there were some genre which are not related to movies such as Music, Talk-Show, News, Reality-TV, Sport were filtered out.\nAlso in holiday_movies.csv the variables which contains of Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa were logical factors and for analysis purpose it was converted into integer factor."

Well the trend for the past few decades was that. Let‚Äôs see how genre distribution in holiday movies, bgh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Distribution of Genres in Holiday Movies\n\n\n\n\n\nWell this plot just tells the same story which we have mentioned earlier, Family Friendly movies takeover holiday movies but still does this means other genre isn‚Äôt necessary? In a business perspective it is true but does it mean it is right?\nWell it is a universal truth that to have family themed movies for holidays but it doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt have other options. In the Gen Z the trend is slowly changing and they are more focuses on sci-fi, animation, action and comedy based movies (Parrot Analytics, 2024). Which will change the future genre demand in holiday movies."

Let‚Äôs take a look at it.\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†1: Movies Representing Different Holidays\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoliday Type\nMovie Count\n\n\n\n\nChristmas\n1929\n\n\nHanukkah\n10\n\n\nKwanzaa\n2\n\n\nHoliday\n330\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting facts to be seen in here, Christmas themed movies are what has taken the center stage in holiday movies and it is not looking good but can‚Äôt blame anyone, Christmas is what most of the world population is looks for.\nThe businesses has put it focus on what makes them profit and that is Christmas, whether you like it or not that‚Äôs the truth (Being part Catholic I stand by my views). Even in countries where you don‚Äôt get to see many people who celebrate Christmas do come together to enjoy the festivity. So my question is if a business can make Christmas into a business Icon why can‚Äôt they do same for the other holidays, In business world if a certain product has a monopoly and only way to break that monopoly by introducing another competitor(s) into the mix.\nIf film a production companies come forward and decide to promote other holidays it will change the outcome of the Table¬†1 and gradually people will focus on other holidays as well."
